# Question
```
There is a bookstore owner that has a store open for n minutes. Every minute, some number of customers enter the store. You are given an integer array customers of length n where customers[i] is the number of the customer that enters the store at the start of the ith minute and all those customers leave after the end of that minute.

On some minutes, the bookstore owner is grumpy. You are given a binary array grumpy where grumpy[i] is 1 if the bookstore owner is grumpy during the ith minute, and is 0 otherwise.

When the bookstore owner is grumpy, the customers of that minute are not satisfied, otherwise, they are satisfied.

The bookstore owner knows a secret technique to keep themselves not grumpy for minutes consecutive minutes, but can only use it once.

Return the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied throughout the day.
```
# Intuition
The quesiton is tedious and redundant so I first do some transformation:

**Calculate the maximum number of customers whom could be satisfied  while bookstore owner has a chance to change their attitude on a consecutive number of days.**

# Approach
1. declare an array to represent how many customers will be unsatisfied on each day
2. calculate how many customers will be satisfied due to the bookstore owner's secret technique on *minutes* consecutive days
3. The answer will be addition of the maximum from step 2 and customers whom are satisfied originally

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***

- Space complexity: ***O(n)***

# Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfied(int[] customers, int[] grumpy, int minutes) {
        int n = customers.length;
        int[] notSatisfied = new int[n];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {//n
            notSatisfied[i] = customers[i] * grumpy[i];
        }
        int prev = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<minutes; i++) {//n
            prev += notSatisfied[i];
        }
        int max = prev; 
        for (int i=minutes; i<n; i++) {//n
            prev = prev - notSatisfied[i - minutes] + notSatisfied[i];
            max = Math.max(max, prev);
        }

        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {//n
            if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
                max += customers[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
