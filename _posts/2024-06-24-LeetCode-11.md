# Question
```
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
```
# Intuition
The answer is the maximum area of the container (width * Min(height[left], height[right]))

The container must have two sides (left & right) so I try two pointers first.

# Approach
The problem is: **When should the left pointer move right and the right pointer move left?**

**Here's the rule:**
- Compare the Area[i+1, j] and Area[i, j-1]. The width of them are equal so we should focus on their heights.
- Assume height[i], height[j], height[i+1], height[j-1] which 0 <= i < j < n
- **If height[i] < height[j], Area[i,j] > Area[i,j-1]**
- **Otherwise, Area[i,j] > Area[i+1,j]**

**Use the example to exmaplify:**
- height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
- i=0, j=8, height[0] < height[8]
- Area[0, 8] = Min(height[0], height[8]) * 8 = 1 * 8 = 8
- Compare two sub-situations: Area[0,7] & Area[1,8]: 
    - Area[0,7] = Min(1, 3) * 7 = 7 (**Maintaining the smaller height (height[0]) cause the result must be smaller than previous result**)
    - Area[1,8] = Min(8, 7) * 7 = 49 (The answer will be in this case)

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***

- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        if (height.length == 1) return 0;
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int max = -1;

        while (left < right) {
            max = Math.max(max, Math.min(height[left], height[right])*(right-left));
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            }else{
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
