# Question
```
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. 
Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
```
# Intuition
**First thought**: Iterate the array and use BS to find another possible value.

**Second thought**: Use two pointers to optimize time complexity from O(nlogn) to O(n)

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(nlogn)***

- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code 1
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0, right = numbers.length-1;
        int tar = 0, mid = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<numbers.length; i++) {
            tar = target - numbers[i];
            while (left <= right) {
                mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if (i != mid && numbers[mid] == tar) {
                    return new int[]{i + 1, mid + 1};
                }
                if (numbers[mid] > tar) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }else{
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            left = 0;
            right = numbers.length - 1;
        }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};
    }
}
```

# Complexity
- Time complexity: ***O(n)***

- Space complexity: ***O(1)***

# Code 2
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = numbers.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int total = numbers[left] + numbers[right];

            if (total == target) {
                return new int[]{left + 1, right + 1};
            } else if (total > target) {
                right--;
            } else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{-1, -1};   
    }
}
```
