### Intro
This article will contain several top algorithms in interviews and its related LeetCode questions. This is like a note other than a complete and thorough instruction to follow. I would save LeetCode questions that I've done and categorized them which may help you and myself as well to find questions in specific fields.

### Fields
- DFS/Backtracking
- Tree
- BFS
- Double Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Bisection
- Stack
- Heap
- Union
- Topology
- DP
