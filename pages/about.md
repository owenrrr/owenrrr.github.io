I have some experience on software development and currently am working on cybersecurity. A huge passion on this field and love to keep working and learning on it.

Currently I'm persuing a Master degree on cybersecurity, and desire to dig into it. Also, I'm working on getting security related certifications, and it's welcome to have a discussion with me.
