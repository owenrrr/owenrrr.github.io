Hello everyone, here's owen and I'm glad to meet you here on my blog. Here is the place I share some technical articles and my learning walkthroughs, and I am aiming to become a profesisonal red teamer/pentester.

Before I have some experience on software engineering and currently am working on cybersecurity related fields. I have **A-HUGE-PASSION** on this field and love to keep working and learning on it.

Currently I'm persuing a Master degree on cybersecurity, and desire to dig deeper. Besides, I keep working on acquiring some security certifications, and it's welcome to have any related discussions with me.
