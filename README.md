### Notice

- After generating new posts for new code, run this command to refresh all html pages in this project
```
    jekyll serve
```

- The reason to do this is that I only generate the Markdown files in the `_posts` directory. However, Jekyll uses `_site` as final version of generating front-end pages, so make sure to run the command to refresh to current version of all html files.
